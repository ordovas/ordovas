Hi there! Iâ€™m a versatile data science consultant based in Madrid. Iâ€™m capable of helping clients to solve their problems creatively and handle complex databases to obtain precise, understandable and useful insights. With a strong scientific background and extensive experience as a Data Scientist, I thrive in the dynamic environment of professional consulting. Having contributed to cross-functional client projects and internal initiatives focused on ML pipelines, I excel in teamwork, meeting deadlines, and effectively communicating complex ideas to non-technical audiences. As a curious and fast learner, I continuously embrace the latest data science techniques, ensuring adaptability and delivering tangible results. My research expertise in the astrophysics field allows me to mine those shiny data spots hidden in the darkness.

#### :earth_africa: Terrenal work:

Iâ€™m always practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist and coding skills. These are some examples I did unrelated with my current job:

-[Library to create a LLM agent to create and execute on-the-fly code to perform simple DS tasks](https://github.com/ordovas/LazyDSGenerator)

-[Dice Scores Recognition in image/video](https://github.com/ordovas/dice-scores-recognition)

-[Predicting the numeric ratings of Amazon books review based exclusively on the text of the review.](https://github.com/ordovas/amazon_books_reviews)

-[A small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and softare video game sales.](https://github.com/ordovas/vg_jp_sales)


Other examples of my work outside GitHub:

-[Microsoft IoT blog post: Retail Self-checkout Object Detection Solution](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/retail-self-checkout-object-detection-solution-using-azure/ba-p/3072914)

-[Presentation I gave (with a coworker) about LLMs performance with mathematical operations.](https://www.youtube.com/live/KaiTZIsTBYk?si=fusV0_Osfi5NkrTR&t=4042)

-[Cognizant blog post about a Computer Vision solution we've worked on.](https://www.cognizant.com/no/en/insights/blog/articles/from-personnel-based-operations-to-ai-driven-automated-maintenance)


Feel free to have a look at other repositories with other exercises, learning notebooks & code or simple tests, even if they are uncomplete or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.

#### :milky_way: Celestial work:

I've worked analyzing the relation (or lack of it) between the optical extinction, X-ray absorption and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei. Apart from that I've also worked using the k-means unsupervised classification algorithm applied to astronomical data. 


You can find my astrophysics research papers and other contributions in [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-1993-0334&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), or read my [PhD Thesis PDF](https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10902/18024/Tesis%20IOP.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) if you want (text in english, summary in both spanish and english).
