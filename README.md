Hi there! Iâ€™m a versatile data science consultant based in Madrid. Iâ€™m capable of helping clients to solve their problems creatively and handle complex databases to obtain precise, understandable and useful insights. I have many years of analytical experience and Iâ€™ve recently started to fully adapt to a professional environment where I am involved in a cross functional clientâ€™s project as well as several internal projects involving machine learning pipelines. My experience helps me apply skills like teamwork, meeting deadlines, and communicating results and complex ideas effectively to a non-technical audience. Iâ€™m a curious and fast learner of latest techniques in data science. My research expertise in the astrophysics field allows me to mine those shiny data spots hidden in the darkness.

#### :earth_africa: Terrenal work:

Iâ€™m currently practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist and coding skills. For example:

-[A small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and softare video game sales.](https://github.com/ordovas/vg_jp_sales)

-[Predicting the numeric ratings of Amazon books review based exclusively on the text of the review.](https://github.com/ordovas/amazon_books_reviews)

-[Codewars exercises to practise SQL queries.](https://github.com/ordovas/SQLnotes)

-[Data Science demos deployed in Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/ordovas/private_streamlit_apps/main/app.py)

Here are some repos of the IRONHACK Data Analytics bootcamp projects that I've done to switch to the data science world:

1. [Hangman game, programmed in Python (moddable)](https://github.com/ordovas/mini-project)
2. [A word frequency based analysis of sharks attacks](https://github.com/ordovas/pandas-project)
3. [500 best albums of all time / Spotify API project](https://github.com/ordovas/pipelines-project)
4. [GeoSpatial Data Project / Choosing the best location for a gaming company](https://github.com/ordovas/geospatial-data-project)
5. [API chat project and text sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ordovas/chat-api.git)
6. [Kaggle competition - Predicting diamonds prices](https://github.com/ordovas/kaggle-diamonds)
7. **FINAL PROJECT:** [Dice Scores Recognition in image/video](https://github.com/ordovas/dice-scores-recognition)



Feel free to have a look at other repositories with other exercises, learning notebooks & code or simple tests, even if they are uncomplete or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.

#### :milky_way: Celestial work:

I've worked analyzing the relation (or lack of it) between the optical extinction, X-ray absorption and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei. Apart from that I've also worked using the k-means unsupervised classification algorithm applied to astronomical data. 


You can find my astrophysics research papers and other contributions in [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-1993-0334&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), or read my [PhD Thesis PDF](https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10902/18024/Tesis%20IOP.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) if you want (text in english, summary in both spanish and english).
