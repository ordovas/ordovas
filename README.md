Hi there! I'm a data scientist and researcher based in Madrid. I've recently coursed the IRONHACK Data Analytics bootcamp.
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ordovaspascual/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NachOrdo), or even [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nachordop/) 

#### :earth_africa: Terrenal work:

Here are some repos of the IRONHACK projects:

1. [Hangman game, programmed in Python (moddable)](https://github.com/nachordo/mini-project)
2. [A word frequency based analysis of sharks attacks](https://github.com/nachordo/pandas-project)
3. [500 best albums of all time / Spotify API project](https://github.com/nachordo/pipelines-project)
4. [GeoSpatial Data Project / Choosing the best location for a gaming company](https://github.com/nachordo/geospatial-data-project)
5. [API chat project and text sentiment analysis](https://github.com/nachordo/chat-api.git)
6. [Kaggle competition - Predicting diamonds prices](https://github.com/nachordo/kaggle-competition)
7. **FINAL PROJECT:** [Dice Scores Recognition in image/video](https://github.com/nachordo/dice-scores-recognition)

I’m currently practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist skills. For example, here I show a small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and softare video game sales dataset. [Click here to have a look at my solution!](https://github.com/nachordo/vg_jp_sales). Feel free to have a look at other repositories even if they are uncomplete or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.
