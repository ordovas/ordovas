Hi there! I am a data scientist with an academic background. I transform complex and large databases into precise, understable and useful pieces of knowledge. I'm always learning new tools to extract valuable information from datasets and improving my code skills. My research expertise in the astrophysics field allows me to mine those shiny data spots hidden in the darkness. After a career change, I've joined Cognizant as a data scientist.

#### :earth_africa: Terrenal work:

Here are some repos of the IRONHACK Data Analytics bootcamp projects:

1. [Hangman game, programmed in Python (moddable)](https://github.com/nachordo/mini-project)
2. [A word frequency based analysis of sharks attacks](https://github.com/nachordo/pandas-project)
3. [500 best albums of all time / Spotify API project](https://github.com/nachordo/pipelines-project)
4. [GeoSpatial Data Project / Choosing the best location for a gaming company](https://github.com/nachordo/geospatial-data-project)
5. [API chat project and text sentiment analysis](https://github.com/nachordo/chat-api.git)
6. [Kaggle competition - Predicting diamonds prices](https://github.com/nachordo/kaggle-diamonds)
7. **FINAL PROJECT:** [Dice Scores Recognition in image/video](https://github.com/nachordo/dice-scores-recognition)

Iâ€™m currently practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist and coding skills. For example:

-[A small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and softare video game sales.](https://github.com/nachordo/vg_jp_sales)

-[Predicting the numeric ratings of Amazon books review based exclusively on the text of the review.](https://github.com/nachordo/amazon_books_reviews)

-[Codewars exercises to practise SQL queries.](https://github.com/nachordo/SQLnotes)

Feel free to have a look at other repositories with other exercises, learning notebooks & code or simple tests, even if they are uncomplete or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.

#### :milky_way: Celestial work:

I've worked analyzing the relation (or lack of it) between the optical extinction, X-ray absorption and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei. Apart from that I've also worked using the k-means unsupervised classification algorithm applied to astronomical data. 


You can find my astrophysics research papers and other contributions in [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22ordov%C3%A1s-pascual%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0), or read my [PhD Thesis PDF](https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10902/18024/Tesis%20IOP.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) if you want (text in english, summary in both spanish and english).
