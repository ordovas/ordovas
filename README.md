Hi there! I’m a versatile data science consultant based in Madrid. I’m capable of helping clients to solve their problems creatively and handle complex databases to obtain precise, understandable and useful insights. I have many years of analytical experience and I’ve recently started to fully adapt to a professional environment where I am involved in a cross functional client’s project as well as several internal projects involving machine learning pipelines. My experience helps me apply skills like teamwork, meeting deadlines, and communicating results and complex ideas effectively to a non-technical audience. I’m a curious and fast learner of latest techniques in data science. My research expertise in the astrophysics field allows me to mine those shiny data spots hidden in the darkness.

#### :earth_africa: Terrenal work:

I’m currently practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist and coding skills. For example:

-[A small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and softare video game sales.](https://github.com/ordovas/vg_jp_sales)

-[Predicting the numeric ratings of Amazon books review based exclusively on the text of the review.](https://github.com/ordovas/amazon_books_reviews)

-[Codewars exercises to practise SQL queries.](https://github.com/ordovas/SQLnotes)

-[Data Science demos deployed in Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/ordovas/private_streamlit_apps/main/app.py)

Here are some repos of the IRONHACK Data Analytics bootcamp projects that I've done to switch to the data science world:

1. [Hangman game, programmed in Python (moddable)](https://github.com/ordovas/mini-project)
2. [A word frequency based analysis of sharks attacks](https://github.com/ordovas/pandas-project)
3. [500 best albums of all time / Spotify API project](https://github.com/ordovas/pipelines-project)
4. [GeoSpatial Data Project / Choosing the best location for a gaming company](https://github.com/ordovas/geospatial-data-project)
5. [API chat project and text sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ordovas/chat-api.git)
6. [Kaggle competition - Predicting diamonds prices](https://github.com/ordovas/kaggle-diamonds)
7. **FINAL PROJECT:** [Dice Scores Recognition in image/video](https://github.com/ordovas/dice-scores-recognition)



Feel free to have a look at other repositories with other exercises, learning notebooks & code or simple tests, even if they are uncomplete or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.

#### :milky_way: Celestial work:

I've worked analyzing the relation (or lack of it) between the optical extinction, X-ray absorption and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei. Apart from that I've also worked using the k-means unsupervised classification algorithm applied to astronomical data.
